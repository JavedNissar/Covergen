To whom it may concern,

I have designed a web application that encrypts user data using the Nacl cryptographic library in the Go programming language. Furthermore,
I built a website for helping users manage their goals using Jquery and Cytoscape.js and I built a utility for automatically generating tweets using Markov Chains. Finally,
I completed two programming courses in Java when I was in high school.

Best regards,
