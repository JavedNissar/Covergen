import programming.languages.go as go
import programming.languages.java as java
import programming.languages.javascript as javascript

To whom it may concern,

I have {go[clearlifegoals]} in the Go programming language. Furthermore,
{javascript[clearlifegoals]} and {javascript[autotweet]}. Finally,
{java[highschool]}.

Best regards,
